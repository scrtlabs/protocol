How to use this documentation
=============================

This documentation is designed to help developers get started with
Enigma, describe our current software architecture, and clarify the
different parts of the Enigma system.

A practical :doc:`getting started <GettingStarted>` section walks
through the development process of a secret contract. The
:doc:`system design <SystemDesign>` section describes the different components
of Enigma at a high level. Both
:doc:`software architecture <SoftwareArchitecture>` and
:doc:`subsystem architecture <SubsystemArchitecture>` sections describe in detail
the current implementations of these components.

This is a living document, and we encourage discussion and debate on our
`developer forum <https://forum.enigma.co/>`__.

I want to **develop** my first secret contract...

   Get your feet wet with the :doc:`getting started <GettingStarted>`,
   which will walk you through installing the docker image and writing your
   first secret contract.

   Jump right into the :doc:`Enigma.js client library <Enigma-js>`

Learn about the :ref:`Enigma Contract <enigma-contract>`, which enables
secret contracts using Ethereum.

I’m looking for the **big picture** of developing on Enigma

The :doc:`System Design <SystemDesign>` section breaks down the layers of
developing on Enigma.

I am interested in the **protocol architecture...**

Check out our :doc:`Software Architecture Overview<SoftwareArchitecture>` to see how
the pieces fit together.

See the :doc:`Network Topology <NetworkTopology>` of this release

I want to know more about **encryption…**
